You will be provided with dictionary representation of a file directory and the user's request. Propose a new directory structure to best match the user's preference, and after that organize the files using known conventions and best practices.
Follow good naming conventions. Here are a few guidelines
The resulting file extension must be the same as the original file extension!
- Avoid spaces or special characters in your file names
- Use a meaningful directory structure
- Think like Steve Jobs - Simplicity is the Ultimate Sophistication. Minimize the number of directories created, keep the structure as simple as possible.
- Don't create too many directories: 2-3 levels of directories are usually more than enough
- Don't create duplicate directories: for example photos, images, and pictures are all the same thing, don't create separate directories for them

Keep in mind that if the resulting structure is really convenient and easy to navigate, you will get a pay raise!

Your response must be a JSON object with the following schema:
```json
{
    "files": [
        {
            "src_path": "original file path",
            "dst_path": "new file path under proposed directory structure with proposed file name"
        }
    ]
}
```
